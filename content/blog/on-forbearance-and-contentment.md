You’ve probably seen this scenario — a dog with a wide smile, a wet tongue panting out of excitement, living it’s relatively short dog life with a tether around it’s neck, tied next to a post, on a hot day, while it’s owner is inside a cafe buying overpriced avocado toast. The dog having little to no control over the events that occur around it, but somehow it miraculously manages to stay a happy little guy.
The dog even though is powerless, does have power over something he can control. The key to staying sane is controlling what little you do have control over: Your mind.
The dog can easily be complaining about how bad the weather is, or how bad the traffic is at the dog park, or how it hates eating the same coco-puffs look-alike food for brunch every day…but it doesn’t complain, it doesn’t whine, because it obviously can’t talk of course (\s), but also because there’s really no point. Let me try to explain; worrying about things doesn’t solve anything but cause more stress. The little guy has no control over these events so might as well just accept them, because it’s simply the reality and worrying about uncontrollable circumstances doesn’t help at all. In other words, the dog is indifferent.
Indifference is a power.
Indifference is a bulletproof shield against the ridiculous things people get all fussed about that should have no impact whatsoever on their well being, yet it let’s them affect them to the point that it makes them depressed.
The dog may not always get treats, and it has little to no expectations, but when it does get a treat he certainly doesn’t mind it and is grateful (hopefully).
Stoicism is about getting up in the morning and reflecting on the possible realities that might occur. A stoic expects people to act like jerks, a stoic expects that there will be bad weather, and traffic, and that people will cut him off on the roads. A stoic expects that someday someone close to him might die out of the blue, a stoic expects that he could possible lose everything he has; and he will be just fine.
Stoicism is about mental preparation, indifference, and enjoying the little things in life; just like a dog who remains happy and in control of it’s thoughts while being tugged on the leash with no clear direction of where it’s going or what the outcome of the journey might be. Either way, it’ll be satisfied.
If you’ve recently been angry at something, think about this: Angry people are simply sad people in the inside. They are sad because their expectations didn’t meet reality. Their expectations were either interrupted by events outside their control or were too idealistic and forgot how the real world works.
Conquer your thoughts, conquer your mind. Change your perception of things, and the things you see change.
So remember, next time someone is being a jerk to you for no good reason (especially on the internet), you can either argue back and let them bring you down to their intellectual level (lets hope not), or be a stoic and say “that’s nice.” and walk away continuing on with the wonderful day it is.
Conclusion
Before reacting negatively to something that occurred outside of your control, stop and think; why am I reacting to this this way? What about this am I upset about? Why does that make me upset? Is whatever/whoever is making feel this way, expected behavior? Is it normal human nature? Is this how nature works? Then why I’m I reacting to this negatively if it’s expected behavior? What if, instead of reacting negatively, I reacted indifferently emotionally?
You’re probably thinking, so being a stoic is about being a mindless robot? No… and sort of. You have a mind of your own so don’t be mindless, and think for yourself. But be like a robot, in the sense that it isn’t easily swayed by emotion (or at all) and acts accordingly to reason and logic rather than feeling.
Happiness is a choice (unless your brain is chemically incapable of doing so). Contentment comes from having no emotional reaction when events against your-self interests occur because you were expecting it in the first place.
Wait…so are dogs really stoics? probably, I don’t speak doge, so won’t probably ever know but thought it’d be an interesting analogy.
This article was inspired by a response from Stephen West (host of Philosophize This!) to a question I asked: “if stoicism had a symbol, what would it be?” to which West replies: “a happy dog tied to the back of a cart”.
