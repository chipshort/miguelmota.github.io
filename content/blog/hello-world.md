Why hello there, and welcome to my blog. I am using [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator, and it is being hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
I will blog about all things web, usually about code and design tips, tricks and techniques.

So yep, that's pretty much it!
