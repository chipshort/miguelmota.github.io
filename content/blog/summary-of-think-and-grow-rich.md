This past weekend I decided to read the book [*Think and Grow Rich*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_and_Grow_Rich) by [Napolean Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Hill). If you are not familiar with Hill, he interviewed hundreds of men with tremendous amounts of wealth, over the span of many years in the early 20th century, to figure out what it takes to bring in riches and fortunes. The findings of his research is what became the book. After reading it I must say that it is one of best books I have ever read in the sense that the value of the information presented is absolutely pricless. Hill tells many stories of successful individuals and the challenges they overcame. It was an inspiring read unlike no other.

Here I outline some of the key points I took away from each chapter of the book.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction
- THOUGHTS translate into DESIRES; don't stop till you get it.
- Keep going no matter what, even after "no"; you do not want to stop digging three feet from gold.
- RICHES BEGIN WITH A STATE OF MIND, WITH DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE.

tldr; THOUGHTS -> DESIRES

## Chapter 2 - DESIRE
- YOU WIN OR YOU PERISH. Burn all bridges and ships behind you. YOU HAVE TO WIN, YOU CANNOT RETURN.
- DESIRE for riches needs to become an OBSESSION which you PLAN and be PERSISTENT, not recognize failure and the riches will come.
- DREAM BIG; DREAMS ARE THE SEEDLINGS OF REALITY.
- STRONG DESIRE: accept no words such as impossible, accept no realities such as failure.
- Remain determined to get what you want even if you have to start with menial work.

tldr; DESIRE -> PLAN -> PERSISTENCE

## Chapter 3 - FAITH
- FAITH is a STATE OF MIND which is induced or created by repeated instructions to the subconscious mind.
- If you repeat a lie, you will eventually accept the lie as truth.
- Need to convince the subconscious mind that you BELIEVE that you will receive what you ask.
- EMOTIONALIZED THOUGHTS mixed with FAITH turn into ACTION.
- Negative believe is the creator of your own misfortune.
- ENCOURAGE positive emotions, ELIMINATE negative emotions.
- The vibrations of repetition of audible words reach the subconscious mind therefor we are what we hear too in our environment.
- A man who thinks he CAN, and a man who think he CANNOT, are BOTH RIGHT.
- Thoughts (faith) translate to physical equivalent.

tldr; IMAGINATION -> IDEA -> FAITH -> PLAN -> ACTION -> PERSISTENCE AND DESIRE -> SUCCESS

## Chapter 4 - AUTO-SUGGESTION
- Man has CONTROL over material that reaches subconscious mind through his five senses.
- AUTO-SUGGESTION is the agency of control which you may VOLUNTARILY feed the subconscious mind.
- Subconscious mind only acts upon on thoughts which have been mixed with EMOTION.
- aUTOSUGGESTION depends on you capacity to CONCENTRATE on your desires.

tldr; AUTO-SUGGESTION -> SUBCONSCIOUS MIND -> DESIRE -> RICHES

## Chapter 5 - SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE
- General knowledge is of little use compared to specialized knowledge.
- What is required is SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE of the profession you intend to offer for money.
- KNOWLEDGE is only *POTENTIAL* POWER.
- Knowledge attracts money if ORGANIZED and directed through PLANS OF ACTION.
- An educated man is one who uses knowledge to acquire what he wants
- An educated man knows where to get knowledge when he needs it.
- Knowledge must be organized for a DEFINITE PURPOSE through PRACTICAL PLANS.
- College degrees are not valued more highly because they represent miscellaneous knowledge.
- Knowledge can only gain value from it's application.
- A person who stops studying after finishing school is doomed to mediocrity.
- Way of success is continuous pursuit of knowledge.
- Success and failure are largely the results of HABIT.

# Chapter 6 - IMAGINATION
- IF MAN CAN IMAGINE IT, HE CAN CREATE IT.
- Man's limitation within reason lies in use of his imagination.
- SYNTHETIC IMAGINATION is the arrangement of old concepts and ideas into new combinations.

## Summary conclusion

Hill makes really solid points in his book. The words DESIRE, PERSISTENCE, and CREATIVE IMAGINATION are emphasized over and over again for a good reason; they are the foundation of bringing riches. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and suggest you give it a read if you have not already. It is inspirational and a mind opener on many levels.
