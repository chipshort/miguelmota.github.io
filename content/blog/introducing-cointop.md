**[cointop](https://github.com/miguelmota/cointop)** is a fast and lightweight interactive terminal based UI application for tracking and monitoring cryptocurrency coin stats in real-time.

The interface is inspired by [`htop`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htop) and shortcut keys are inspired by [`vim`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)).

```

For other platforms, check out the [releases](https://github.com/miguelmota/cointop/releases) page or read the installation instructions in the [README](https://github.com/miguelmota/cointop).

The Go build size is ~8MB but packed with [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) it's only a ~3MB executable binary. It only uses ~15MB of memory so you can run it on a Raspberry Pi Zero if you wanted to (one reason why cointop was built using Go instead of Node.js or Python).

cointop is [open-source](https://github.com/miguelmota/cointop) and released under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/miguelmota/cointop/#license).
