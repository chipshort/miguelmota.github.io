Everyone now-a-days seems to have their own url shortening service, such as goo.gl, t.co, youtu.be, fb.me, git.io, and so on.

So I thought I'd have my own as well, and therefore [mig.gs™](http://mig.gs) was born.

[mig.gs™](http://mig.gs)> offers basic analytics using [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/)> to display daily clicks and generate a QR code. It also displays a Google map of your link visitors by using their IP Address. You can make an account to save your links or use a custom word instead of a random code if you'd like, kind of like bit.ly
