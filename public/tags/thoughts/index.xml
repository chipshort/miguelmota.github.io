      <description>Everyone now-a-days seems to have their own url shortening service, such as goo.gl, t.co, youtu.be, fb.me, git.io, and so on.
So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have my own as well, and therefore mig.gs™ was born.
mig.gs™&amp;gt; offers basic analytics using Google Charts API&amp;gt; to display daily clicks and generate a QR code. It also displays a Google map of your link visitors by using their IP Address. You can make an account to save your links or use a custom word instead of a random code if you&amp;rsquo;d like, kind of like bit.</description>

The zombie apocalypse is near as we know it, but the question is, are you ready for it? You wake up on a gloomy Monday morning, only to find your deceased yet viable emotionless little sister munching savagely on your mother&amp;rsquo;s juicy, bloody human flesh.</description>
