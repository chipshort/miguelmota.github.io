      <description>In this tutorial I will go over Backbone.js main components: Models, Collections, Views, and Routes. We will not be building an application but instead we will be going over a number of simple examples of each Backbone compoment, that hopefully after we are done you will have a firm understanding of Backbone.js and be able to put it all together.
Models Models are a key component of Backbone applications. With model objects you can easily keep track of your data and update as needed.</description>
