      <description>Raspberry Pi camera board   So you got your Raspberry Pi and decided to get a Camera Board to do something awesome with it. Why not turn it a simple video streamer?

      <description>The Raspberry Pi has an infinite amount of uses and one of them is using it as a network server. This is handy because people in your home network can connect to this network server and access shared files, such as movies and music, which can be streamed to your TV. I will be going over how to set this up on a fresh RPi.
Install Raspbian Raspbian is a light-weight Debian based Linux distro tailored for the RPi.</description>
