      <h3><div class="avatar" aria-hidden="true"></div> Hi, I'm <strong>Miguel Mota</strong>.</h3>

      <p>~7 years of experience doing software development, mainly dealing with full-stack web development. Some of my interests are Golang, Node.js, FRP, web audio, Python, Vim, Docker, distributed systems, software architecture, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and decentralized systems in general.</p>

      <p>Some other tidbits about me are: I constantly enjoy learning new things, which is also my weakness because I'm always jumping from project to project. When there's time to spare you can find me on on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1439168/miguel-mota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackOverflow</a> answering questions. <em>"Make it run, make it right, make it fast"</em> is the general programming process I follow. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stoicism</a> is a philosophy I live by on a daily basis (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marcus Aurelius</a> is my favorite stoic).
