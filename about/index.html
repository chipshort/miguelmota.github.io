      <h3><div class="avatar" aria-hidden="true"></div> Hi, I'm <strong>Miguel Mota</strong>.</h3>

      <p>~7 years of experience doing software development, mainly dealing with full-stack web development. Some of my interests are Golang, Node.js, FRP, web audio, Python, Vim, Docker, distributed systems, software architecture, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and decentralized systems in general.</p>

      <p>Some other tidbits about me are: I constantly enjoy learning new things, which is also my weakness because I'm always jumping from project to project. "Make it run, make it right, make it fast" is the general programming process I follow. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stoicism</a> is a philosophy I live by.
